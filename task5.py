# TASK 5: Using Python or PHP or Java or Ruby or JavaScript
# Implement a program that takes 3 users  inputs from the terminal or the Browser, and stores them in three variables. Return the largest of the three. Do this without using the the inbuilt max () function!
# The goal of this exercise is to think about some internals that programs normally take care of for us.
